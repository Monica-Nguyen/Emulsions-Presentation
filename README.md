# Emulsions-Presentation
# This was a poster presentation completed in December 2019 with a group of three. We collaborated regularly to communicate and discuss ideas on how to present our story. We presented using strong verbal skills and interaction with the audience. By conducting thorough research in primary literature sources, we were prepared to answer questions in discussions that followed.

# Emulsions-Presentation
# This was a poster presentation completed in December 2019 with a group of three. We collaborated regularly to communicate and discuss ideas for how to present our story. By conducting thorough research in primary literature sources, we were prepared to answer questions in the question and answer period that followed using strong oral skills.
